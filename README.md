# Rajesh Gadeparthi

## About Me

I’m a **Principal / Staff-level Backend Engineer** with **17+ years of hands-on experience** building backend platforms across **digital payments, acquiring, consumer banking, investment & trading, automation platforms, and analytics-heavy systems**.

My core strength lies in **designing and implementing distributed backend systems** where **transaction correctness, scalability, data modeling, and operational reliability** are critical. I’ve consistently worked close to the code while also owning **system design, POCs, and architectural decision-making**.

## Backend & System Design Focus

- Strong hands-on background in **Java-based backend systems**
- Deep experience with:
  - **Domain Driven Design**
  - **API-first architectures**
  - **Event Driven Microservices**
  - **Distributed data & computing architectures**
- Regularly involved in:
  - discovery phases
  - C4 modeling and sequence flows
  - feasibility studies and architectural POCs
- Focused on **“ilities”**: scalability, resilience, observability, and maintainability

## Kubernetes & Container Platforms (Actual Usage)

My Kubernetes experience is **practical and implementation-driven**, aligned with platforms I’ve worked on.

- Hands-on experience with:
  - **Kubernetes and OpenShift**
  - Containerized backend services (primarily Spring-based)
- Used Kubernetes in environments involving:
  - multi-service backend platforms
  - automation workloads
  - analytics and data-heavy services
- Comfortable operating in setups that require:
  - horizontal scaling
  - service isolation
  - deployment coordination across multiple services
- Kubernetes exposure is reinforced through **real application deployment and runtime behavior**, not just theoretical knowledge

## AWS & Cloud Infrastructure

I have **hands-on exposure to AWS**, primarily from the perspective of **backend engineers designing systems that run reliably in the cloud**.

- Worked with AWS for:
  - backend service hosting
  - data-heavy workloads
  - integration and messaging use cases
- Experience includes:
  - **AWS CloudFormation** for infrastructure provisioning
  - designing systems aware of cloud constraints and cost considerations
- Familiar with building systems that assume:
  - distributed infrastructure
  - environment isolation
  - secure access and integration patterns

My AWS certifications reflect **applied understanding**, backed by implementation experience rather than isolated lab work.

## Big Data, Analytics & Distributed Data Systems

Big Data and analytics have been a **significant part of my career**, not a side skill.

### Analytics Platforms

- Hands-on experience with:
  - **Apache Druid**
  - **Presto / Distributed SQL**
  - column-oriented and time-series data models
- Contributed to and built analytics platforms such as:
  - **HawkEye Analytics Platform**
- Designed systems handling:
  - large-scale data ingestion
  - near real-time analytics
  - high-volume aggregations

---

### Big Data Ecosystem

- Practical exposure to:
  - **Hadoop ecosystem**
  - **Spark, Impala**
  - MPP-style analytical systems
- Used Big Data tools selectively based on:
  - access patterns
  - latency requirements
  - operational complexity

## Databases & Storage (Multi-Model Experience)

I’ve worked across **relational, NoSQL, graph, search, and in-memory data systems**, choosing technology based on use-case rather than trends.

- Relational:
  - MySQL, MariaDB, MS SQL Server
- NoSQL & Distributed:
  - Cassandra, MongoDB
- Search & Indexing:
  - Elasticsearch
- Graph:
  - Neo4j, JanusGraph, OrientDB
- In-memory & Low-latency:
  - Redis, Apache Ignite
- Analytics Stores:
  - Apache Druid, Presto DB
- Experience includes **POCs and production usage**, depending on context

---

## Streaming, Messaging & Integration

- Strong experience with:
  - **Apache Kafka**
  - event-driven backend systems
- Designed Kafka-based pipelines for:
  - transaction processing
  - analytics ingestion
  - async workflows
- Also worked with:
  - AWS SNS & SQS
  - Apache Storm
  - StreamSets
  - Apache Camel and Mule (integration-focused use cases)

---

## Payments, Banking & Enterprise Platforms

Across roles at **Tide, DBS, ServiceNow, Innominds**, I’ve worked on:

- **Digital & POS payments**
- **Acquiring systems**
- **Refund and chargeback workflows**
- **Banking onboarding (including VKYC)**
- **Investment & trading platforms**
- **Automation platforms**
- **Customer knowledge graph systems**

These systems typically involved **high data volumes, strict correctness guarantees, and non-trivial operational constraints**.

---

## How I Work

- Strong analytical mindset
- Comfortable working independently with minimal supervision
- Prefer:
  - clear domain models
  - explicit data flows
  - observable and debuggable systems
- Hands-on by default, even in senior roles

---

## Current Focus

- Backend systems in **payments and acquiring**
- Distributed transaction handling
- Event-driven architectures
- Analytics-aware backend design
- System design backed by POCs, not slides
